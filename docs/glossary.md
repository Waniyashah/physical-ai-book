# Glossary of Robotics Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and acronyms used throughout this book.

### A

*   **Action (ROS)**: A communication mechanism in ROS for long-running, asynchronous tasks that provide feedback. It consists of a goal, feedback, and a result.
*   **AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization)**: A probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in 2D. It's a key component of the ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2).

### D

*   **Digital Twin**: A virtual model of a physical object or system. It serves as a digital counterpart for simulation, testing, and monitoring.

### G

*   **Gazebo**: A powerful 3D robot simulator that allows for accurate and efficient testing of robots in complex environments.

### I

*   **Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool, built on the Omniverse platform.

### J

*   **Joint (URDF)**: Connects two links and defines the relative motion between them.

### L

*   **Link (URDF)**: A rigid body of the robot.
*   **LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.

### N

*   **Nav2**: The ROS 2 Navigation Stack, a framework for mobile robot navigation.
*   **Node (ROS)**: A process that performs computation. A ROS 2 application is typically composed of many nodes.

### R

*   **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

### S

*   **Service (ROS)**: A request/response communication mechanism in ROS. It's used for synchronous, two-way communication.

### T

*   **Topic (ROS)**: A named bus over which nodes exchange messages. Topics use a publish/subscribe communication model.

### U

*   **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML file format used in ROS to describe all elements of a robot.

### V

*   **VLA (Vision-Language-Action) Model**: A type of AI model that connects visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical robot actions.
