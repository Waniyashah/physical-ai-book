# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: A Practical Guide

Welcome to the forefront of robotics innovation. This book provides a practical, hands-on journey into the world of Physical AI, guiding you through the essential concepts and technologies required to build and control intelligent humanoid robots. From the foundational "nervous system" of ROS 2 to advanced AI-driven control with NVIDIA Isaac and Vision-Language-Action models, you will gain the skills to bring intelligent machines to life.

## Curriculum Overview

This book is organized into four distinct modules, each building upon the last to provide a comprehensive learning path:

-   **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Learn the fundamentals of the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2, the standard open-source framework for robotics middleware.
-   **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Master the art of creating and simulating robots in virtual environments using industry-standard tools like Gazebo and Unity.
-   **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**: Integrate powerful AI perception and navigation capabilities into your robots using NVIDIA's advanced Isaac Sim and ROS modules.
-   **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Explore the cutting-edge of AI by implementing a system that allows you to control a robot using natural language commands.
