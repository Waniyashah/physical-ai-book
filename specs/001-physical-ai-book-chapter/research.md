# Research Plan

**Decision**: A research-concurrent approach will be adopted. This means that research will be conducted on a just-in-time basis while writing the content for each chapter.

**Rationale**: This approach ensures that the information is always up-to-date with the latest versions of the specified software and hardware. It also allows for a more agile workflow, where the writing process is not blocked by a large upfront research phase.

**Primary Sources**:
- ROS 2 Humble Documentation
- Gazebo Documentation
- Unity Robotics Hub
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim Documentation
- NVIDIA Isaac ROS Documentation
- Nav2 Documentation
- URDF and SDF Specifications
- Intel RealSense SDK Documentation
- Unitree Robotics Developer Documentation

**Citation Style**: All sources will be cited using the APA citation style, as specified in the project constitution.
