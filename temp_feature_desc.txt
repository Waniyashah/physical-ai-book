AI Book Chapter: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
Target audience:
- Students learning embodied AI and robotics
- Beginners in ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, and conversational robotics
- Readers preparing for a capstone in humanoid robot design and simulation
Focus:
- Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Bridging AI models with real-world robotic systems
- Designing, simulating, and controlling humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac
- Integrating Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for Human-Robot Interaction
Success criteria:
- Explains Physical AI fundamentals in simple, clear language
- Covers all 4 modules (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA)
- Includes practical workflows, examples, and agent-ready specifications
- Describes weekly breakdown (Weeks 1–13) with clarity and structure
- Summarizes hardware requirements and lab setup accurately
- Provides a complete understanding of humanoid robotics, simulation, and AI control
- Enables a student to conceptualize and begin building a Physical AI project
Constraints:
- Length per chapter: 800–2000 words
- Format: Markdown/MDX (Docusaurus compatible)
- Code: Valid fenced code blocks (Python, ROS 2 launch files, URDF)
- Explain complex robotics terms in simple language
- Avoid vendor promotions or unnecessary product reviews
- No plagiarism; all content must be original
- Must include at least one L1–L7 specification for each module
- All hardware specs must be accurate and realistic
Not building:
- A complete robotics textbook covering all robotics math
- Full control theory (only conceptual explanations)
- Detailed Unity/Isaac SDK tutorials at the API level
- A mechanical engineering guide for robot fabrication
- Step-by-step humanoid robot construction instructions
Project scope includes:
- Physical AI concepts and embodied intelligence foundations
- ROS 2 architecture: nodes, topics, services, actions
- URDF and SDF robot description formats
- Gazebo and Unity simulation workflows
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, navigation, perception
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for conversational robots
- Capstone design: Autonomous humanoid controlled through speech, planning, navigation, and manipulation
- Hardware requirements for workstation, Jetson kits, sensors, and robots
- Architecture diagrams and recommended lab setups (on-premise vs cloud)
Timeline:
- Produce chapter draft within 2–3 days
- Produce module-level L1–L7 specs immediately after chapter approval
